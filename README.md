# <span style="color:yellow">Spam Classification Project</span>

## <span style="color:green">Overview</span>
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam using various machine learning models. The dataset used in this project contains labeled SMS messages indicating whether they are spam or not spam.

## <span style="color:green">Features</span>
- <span style="color:orange">Data preprocessing</span>: The SMS messages are preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- <span style="color:orange">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span>: Various visualizations are used to analyze the distribution of spam and not spam messages.
- <span style="color:orange">Feature Engineering</span>: Additional features such as the number of characters, words, and sentences are extracted from the SMS messages.
- <span style="color:orange">Model Building</span>: Several machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, etc., are trained and evaluated.
- <span style="color:orange">Model Improvement</span>: Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods like Voting Classifier are employed to improve model performance.
- <span style="color:orange">Saving the Model</span>: The trained model and vectorizer used for feature extraction are saved for future use.

## <span style="color:green">Requirements</span>
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, scikit-learn, xgboost, wordcloud
